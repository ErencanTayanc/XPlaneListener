# X-Plane Connect
This research tool has been used to visualize flight paths, test control algorithms, simulate an active airspace, or generate out-the-window visuals for in-house flight simulation software. Possible applications include active control of an XPlane simulation, flight visualization, recording states during a flight, or interacting with a mission over UDP.

All special chars like [Space][,][/][*][-][#] etc. change with _ char. For example:

L/D, ratio ->   L_D_ratio
L/D, *etaP  ->  L_D__etaP
